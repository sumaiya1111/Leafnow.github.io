     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <blockquote>Ever since industrialization started the care for plants has made it to our least priority
list, Even though mankind requires plants to balance the food chain that heâ€™s a part of,
but the plant enthusiasts are everywhere, be it big metropolitan cities or rural areas, so
we aim to bring in a platform that can connect these plant/nature enthusiasts and help
them exchange/sell them plants or donate seeds/plants as part of the green initiative
that we started 2 years back.</blockquote>
